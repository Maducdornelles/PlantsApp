# PLANT PARADISE

The "Plantinhas" project constitutes a React Native mobile application aimed at enabling users to explore, buy, oversee indoor plants, and incorporate items into their favorites list. Among its functionalities are user authentication through Firebase, plant catalog, detailed plant information, a shopping cart, favorites administration, and the utilization of Redux for global state management. TypeScript has also been employed in the project to bolster security and mitigate potential errors.
